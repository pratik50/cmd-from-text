# Cmd-from-text

This project is a basic command-line tool that converts natural language into Linux shell commands with the help of Gemini, Google’s generative AI. This project is created for learning how to build and integrate CLI libraries.

## Under Development

This is a simple, executable version built for learning purposes. The core functionality is working, but it’s just the beginning, and it will be expanded with more features and improvements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratik50/cmd-from-text.git
```

2.	Create a .env file from .env.example and add your Gemini API key.
   
```bash
npm install 
```  

3.	Create a .env file from .env.example and add your Gemini API key.

## Development

This project is still basic but built to learn about CLI libraries and AI integration. Future improvements will focus on error handling, better AI interactions, and adding more features.
